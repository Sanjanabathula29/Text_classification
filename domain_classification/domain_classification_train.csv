Sit back for a second and think about what your life has become. ............ Done? That didn't take long did it? Nope.

You can go ahead and delete my profile from wikipedia. I'll just make another one and come right back to 'Syrthiss's talk page and insult the dick off of you. How could you shatter the dreams of an innocent eighteen year old college freshman trying to make a name for his band. Does that make you happy? Fucking with people because you're an overweight, single, old man in a dead-end job. Did you spot that perhaps someone else was going to follow his dreams and you were trying to hold him back so somebody else could suffer like you? Yes you did. I don't make empty threats, so I won't be saying anything along the lines of 'i'll hurt you' or 'i'll eat the children from within your sister's womb', but I will say that you are a asshole, son-of-a-bitch, mother fucking cock sucker. So, go eat some more food and drown your sorrows you premature ejaculating, bald headed fuck.

That is not strictly geography, and belongs in the introduction. Climate belongs towards the latter part of the page, perhaps before toursim. Regions and cities is not such an interesting combination.

"I've tried to be as objective as possible, and treat the author in my head as someone who's first tongue is not English.  I think Davies is borderline notable, but the article is not.  I spent an hour googling Davies earlier today and found nothing except that he has translated a lot of stuff.  Well, I have done a lot of stuff in my life.  I'm even borderline notable in a small field, but nothing to warrant an article on me, especially one that precisley nothing links to like this one.  Frankly I hope the author just makes it notable.  I'll respond to him with gentlemanly politesse, but I can;t help him any further.",Non-Toxic,,,,,
